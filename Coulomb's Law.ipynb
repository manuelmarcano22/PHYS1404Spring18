If the two charges have the same sign then the force is **repulsive**, if they are opposite sign then the force will be **attractive**. Let's write two equations to find $q_1$ and $q_2$ for the first case where they have the same sign and thus the force is a repulsive one. Let's assume both are positive and lets call $Q_{total}$ the total charge. . We know two things:\n",
